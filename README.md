# MedicalChatbot
  Ai chatbot framework that
  based on text similarity model. to help answering complex
  medical questions. the chatbot system implements a novel text
  representation and similarity deep learning model, Hierarchical
  BiLSTM Attention Model (HBAM),to find the most similar
  question from a large QA dataset. We train and test the models
  with a subset of the Quora duplicate questions dataset in the
  medical area. The experimental results show that our model
  is able to achieve a superior performance than these existing
  methods.
